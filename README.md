## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine

```bash

```

Before installing dependancies, it is recommended to use virtual environments to install and run this application.  See Virtual Environments section if you are unsure to use virtual environments.

## Install dependencies

```bash
pip install bottle

```

## Create the SQLite Database

If you do not want to use our version of the database, delete the file todo.db & recreate it using the python below.

```bash
python create-db.py

```

## Start the TODO app

```bash
python index.py
```

Then in an internet browser, open the application at the following URL http://localhost:8080/

## Virtual Environment

As with all python projects, it is recommended to run this application in a virtual environment.

Follow the instructions below to get started.

### Create the Virtual Environment

Use the venv module to create a virtual environment inside the project folder. Run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv --system-site-packages .venv

```

Replace .venv with your preferred name for the virtual environment if you do not want to use our preference.

### Activate the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, use the appropriate command based on your operating system:

#### On Windows

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate

```

#### On macOS, Linux or IBM i

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate

```

### Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When youâ€™re done working in the virtual environment, deactivate it:

```bash
deactivate
```

Remember to activate it whenever you work on your project. ðŸ˜Š
